      <h4>Confusion is your ally!</h4>
      <p>When you start programming your first web app you're doing something that you've never done
        before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
        so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

      <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you've
        engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
        to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits. Not to mention the accompanying warm and fuzzy feelings.</p>

      <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
      <p>When you're learning a new technology, whether you're learning to write your first programming
        language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
        the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
      </p>

      <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
        of the process.</p>

      <p>Part of learning a new programming language is learning to train your eye. 
        The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
        totally understand what it's doing.</p>

      <h4>Elastic habits will save you. </h4> 
      <p>Since consistency is key and life doesn't always go according to plan, it's super helpful to have a range of 
        target study time frames. X hours when it's an amazing day, y hours if 
        it's an average day, and z hours when it's the worst day ever. You'll still be able to get your coding in, you'll still be making progress
        and you'll feel like a rock star.</p>
