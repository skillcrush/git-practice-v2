      <h4>Take your time</h4>
      <p>Learning to code is hard work. It's easy to feel like you are already behind. But the fact that you are here and getting started now is all that matters. Take your time and know that each small step you take is moving you towards your goal!</p>

      <h4>Small steps daily make a huge difference</h4>
      <p>Doing a little bit every day will get you further than you realize. If you just learn for 30 minutes a day, by the end of the year you will have done over 180 hours of learning! That HUGE!
      </p>

      <h4>Practice, practice, practice!</h4>
      <p>The more you practice, the more you will learn and the more confident you will feel with your new coding skills! Take any opportunity to find new projects and ways to get more practice!</p>
