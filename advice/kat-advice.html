    <h1>Hi, my name is Kat and here's some advice.</h1>
  </header>

  <section>
    <div class="advice">
      <h4>You are never too old to learn something new, like coding</h4>
      <p>No matter how old you are, you can learn to code if you want, or for that matter, learn anything new.</p>

      <p>Life-long learning keeps your brain active and agile. Make it a goal to learn something new every day.</p>

      <h4>No question is a "dumb" question</h4>
      <p>Ask questions when you don't understand something. Communicate with your team that you are confused.
      </p>

      <p>Trust me, it's far better to be upfront when you aren't sure of something than muddle along and get confused worse.</p>

      <p>If you don't understand something, say something. Your team would much rather you ask questions or ask for advice than screw up a project because you were afraid to speak up. A great book to read about communication is Alan Alda's book "If I Understood You, Would I Have This Look on My Face?" It's an excellent book about communicating with others.
